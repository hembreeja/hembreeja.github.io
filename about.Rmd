![optional caption text](figures/img.png)
While I am a student at Appalachian State University, contrary to popular belief, I do not spend all my time studying or doing homework.
When I'm not doing schoolwork I can be found anywhere from the top of a mountain exploring the world to lounging on the couch watching baking shows, sipping coffee and crotcheting.
I'm currently not employed (mainly not to overwork myself and balance work and free time), however, my past jobs have include being a Lifeguard, Camp Councelor, Math Tutor, and Work Study (For more indepth description visit my resume page.)
