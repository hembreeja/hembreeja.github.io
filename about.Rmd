> While I am a student at Appalachian State University, contrary to popular belief, I do not spend all my time studying or doing homework.
When I'm not doing schoolwork I can be found anywhere from the top of a mountain ![](https://mathr.math.appstate.edu/s/8ba723dc65fc1a6ac6527/files/Repositories/hembreeja.github.io/Images/IMG-0352.JPG)  exploring the world   ![](https://mathr.math.appstate.edu/s/8ba723dc65fc1a6ac6527/files/Repositories/hembreeja.github.io/Images/IMG-0068.JPG)  to lounging on the couch watching baking shows, sipping coffee and crotcheting...or just hammocking.  
  
I'm currently not employed (mainly not to overwork myself and also to balance work and free time), however, my past jobs have included being a Lifeguard, Camp Councelor, Math Tutor, and Work Study (For more indepth description visit my resume page.)
