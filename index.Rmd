####Hello and welcome to my website!  
My name is Jared Hembree and I am currently a student at [Appalachian State University](https://www.appstate.edu/).
My intended major is Mathematics with a potential minor in Statistics or Computing.
I am an unofficial nature photographer, which is mostly fueled by my obsession with nature and capturing beautiful scenery.
My hobbies include hiking, swimming, playing piano and spending time with friends.
